# Surviving Winter 

I’m from Los Angeles. When I first moved to the Midwest back in 2012, I was laughably
unprepared for the cold. Don’t be like me. (And don’t let fall fool you,
when the temperature does go south, it’ll go south hard and fast.)

How cold does it get? It’ll be below freezing pretty much continuously
for several months in the winter. And there are many days when it gets
significantly below 0(F).

The coldest recent winter was the winter of 2013-4. That year,
temperatures landed in the -20 range. (Yes, this is still Fahrenheit.)
Even when it warmed up a little, temperatures were routinely colder than
places like Moscow and Anchorage.

But it gets worse: these are temperatures before wind chill. It’s very
windy around here. In case you’re not familiar with the concept (I
wasn’t when I got here), windchill is (speaking a little bit loosely,
physics people don’t laugh at me) a measure of the rate at which you
lose heat, taking into account the temperature reported by the (lying)
weather app on your phone and the windspeed, and then normalized to a
kind of made-up “feels like” number, but where that number apparently
matters for things like losing bits of your body to frostbite (that
would be bad), and possibly also dying of hypothermia. And also just how
bloody horrible it is to be outdoors. During the “polar vortex” winter,
windchill got down to the -50 range.

## Weather Forecasts are Nonsense

The weather forecasts tend to be hilariously inaccurate at anything
further than ten minutes into the future. You cannot expect the forecast
from yesterday (or even from the morning) to accurately predict either
temperature or snowfall for the coming day. Always carry adequately warm
clothing (see below), as well as gear for whatever
temperature-appropriate kind of precipitation could happen that day
(snow, rain, freezing rain, etc.).

Also, it is imperative to subscribe to a weather alert service that
sends text messages or push notifications or the like when, e.g., a blizzard or a patch of sub-sub-sub
freezing wind is rolling in (these can come out of nowhere). I used to subscribe
to the weather alerts offered by
[“Accuweather”](https://alert.accuweather.com/accualert/), but then I realized that their *unsubscribe* page doesn't work, so I couldn't get off it when I moved from Iowa City to Chicago, and ended up having to block their numbers and e-mails.  Now I just use the [Carrot Weather](https://www.meetcarrot.com/weather/) app's push notifications, and also pay their ridiculous subscription prices in order to have maximum weather data and customizable notifications and weather maps on my watch (!!) and all the rest.  This sort of stuff is necessary when you live in the Midwest, trust me.  

These weather alerts will be infuriating. They send exactly the same
alert for “hey, it’s going to be a little bit foggy this morning, but
it’ll burn off by 6:45” and “the streets are covered with twelve feet of
snow, nineteen people were struck by lightning in the time it took to
type this weather alert, all nonessential services are shut down,
sinkholes are opening on the sidewalk, and starving baby deer have
turned carnivorous and have all the elementary schools under siege.”
Apparently their parents never read them the story of the boy who cried
wolf. Nonetheless, the alerts are also a good way to learn about
impending sky-assassination attempts, so read them anyway.

## Traveling is Hard

Do not expect plans to be reliable. Travel out of town may become
impossible on short notice: the roads may be impassible, and the
airports may be non-functional. Leave lots of extra time in all travel
plans of any kind. I just plan to lose a whole day on both ends of any
air travel plans to account for flight delays and cancellations. (Rule
of thumb: United is always delayed, Delta is always overbooked, American
is about half one and half the other. And everything goes wrong in the
winter on every airline.)

This is especially going to be a problem if you live in a small city, like most college towns.  When I was in Iowa City, I got stranded *constantly*, because everything goes through a connection, there are basically no direct flights anywhere except to a handful of major hubs: mostly O'Hare for points east and Denver for points west, though you can also get Detroit, Minneapolis, Dallas/Forth-Worth, and Charlotte. That's probably true for most small airports in the Midwest. 

If you are flying, and you get stranded at O’Hare, the airport Hilton is
very expensive (\$200+/night) and fills up fast, but it has the distinct
advantage of actually being physically attached to the airport, so you
won’t have to go outdoors or wait for some shuttle to get you there for
your rebooked flight (which is invariably at 6 in the morning). Call
them to make a reservation the moment your flight plans get screwed up,
while you’re in line to rebook. If you’d like to save money, you can
often find very good deals at airport hotels within quick shuttle range
on hotwire.com. Hoteltonight is also good, but act fast: it’s not
uncommon during big Midwest weather airport strandings to be in the
middle of booking a hotel on hoteltonight and have it sell out as you’re
typing in your credit card number.

## Walking: Don’t Break Your Neck or Get Hit by a Car

Sidewalks may, depending on how good your city is at clearing them, be covered with ice for months on end. It’s very hard to
walk on them, and you’ll need to walk very slowly. If you fall (and you
will), try to land directly on your rear-end, rather than catching
yourself with your hands (and possibly breaking wrists), back-flopping,
etc. Products like
[Yaktrax](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0094GO6HO/) that go on the
bottom of your shoes to supply extra traction can help.

Winter can also seriously impair your visibility. If you wear glasses,
expect them to fog up with the condensation. Hoods undermine your
peripheral vision. Combine this with slippery sidewalks, drivers who
don’t stop for pedestrians, and slick roads that make braking difficult
(see below, driving), and crossing the street can be *very dangerous*.
Leave lots of time to walk anywhere, and don’t expect drivers to be
either willing or able to stop for you.

## Housing: Winter Screws That Up Too

Heating bills will be very high. Plan for, depending on the size of your
house, up to a couple hundred dollars a month for heating. You can
reduce these bills by attending to insulation in your home. One thing
that I do is cover the windows with plastic, using a product [like
this](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NHW2Z6/).

You need to make sure you know whether you or your landlord is
responsible for snow removal. Even if your landlord takes responsibility
for this, landlords may not be terribly prompt, so you may still want to invest
in a good sturdy shovel in order to establish access to your home (especially driveways) before
the landlord gets around to it. Also, you’ll want to invest in some kind
of salt or a more pet-safe equivalent to melt ice. I use [this
stuff](https://www.amazon.com/Safe-Paw-Non-Toxic-Melter-lbs/dp/B0002IJXDA/).

## Stay Sane

Psychological well-being is also important; being trapped indoors in the
cold and dark all the time can get incredibly depressing. A Minnesotan
friend: "Walk outside every day no matter how cold it is. Supplement
with Vitamin D. Plan a sunny vacation if you can. Consider a light box."
I do not endorse the “walk outside” part.

## Clothing

Here are some principles to guide your choice of clothing:

### Wear Layers

The temperature can vary widely in a day, and it will also vary widely
between indoors and outdoors. Imagine walking into a building heated to
60 from outdoors at -10: you’ll be covered with sweat in an instant if
you’re wearing outdoors-appropriate clothing and you can’t shed them
quickly.

It can be helpful to keep an extra bag to conveniently carry winter
clothing while indoors.

### Natural Fabrics (Mostly) Beat Artificial Fabrics

Evolution has had a really long time to devise solutions for extreme
temperatures. The only artificial fabrics I’ll wear in the winter are
outer layers with gore-tex/nylon-ish shells (and other waterproof
fabrics), long underwear with some small percentage of spandex, and
occasionally a layer of polyester fleece.

Wool is your friend. Alpaca is *really* your friend (though it can be a
bit itchy, it’s incredibly warm). Down is your very best friend. Fur is
your friend, though it can be expensive and animal rights types won’t be
happy.^[Much like there are no atheists in foxholes, there are no PETA members in -20.]  

Cotton is not your friend. If it gets wet, cotton becomes very, very bad
at holding in heat. It actually draws heat away from your body.

Getting wet includes getting wet from sweat. This is why layers are so
important. It’s easy to overdo the warm weather gear, be unable to
gradually reduce it, start to sweat, and then to make yourself colder in
the long run.

Merino wool is a little bit softer and a little bit more expensive than
ordinary sheep/lambswool. Cashmere is much softer and much more
expensive, but you can sometimes get a bargain, especially at
consignment stores in big cities. Alpaca is cheaper and warmer than
cashmere, almost as soft, but, as I said, a bit itchy
sometimes.^[If you really have a lot of money, the warmest wool of all is supposed to be qiviut, which comes from the belly fur of an Alaskan musk ox or some other such ridiculous thing. I’ve never tried it, however, as it’s extraordinarily expensive. My best advice for being able to afford it is to play scrabble for money, use the word "qiviut" to crush your opponents, and then use your winnings to buy yourself a lovely scarf.]

Many manufacturers put acrylic in cheap knitwear. *Do not buy this
garbage.* Some people have wool allergies. If that’s you, poly fleece is
still better than acrylic for most things. Acrylic is horrible.

The other main problem with woolen-type things is static electricity. I can't help you there, I've never managed to figure out how to not shock myself whenever I do something simple like touch the fridge. I've also never taken a physics class, which doesn't help.  Engineers, some help here?

### Jackets

This is the most important piece. You need a heavy down-lined jacket
with a hood. These are expensive, but worth every penny.

L.L. Bean jackets is a pretty good option, they tend to make very warm coats for a reasonable price. I've owned two at various points, the first, which seems to not currently be
on sale except in inferior versions, is the
[Windstopper](http://www.slate.com/articles/life/fashion/2014/01/l_l_bean_windstopper_the_winter_coat_you_need_to_survive_an_ungodly_cold.html),
stuffed with 700-fill goose down. The second, which is still on sale, is
the [Baxter State
Parka](http://www.llbean.com/llb/shop/60850?page=baxter-state-parka)
(there’s a women’s version too). These are both \$250-\$300 jackets, and
worth every penny (although the fake fur on the Baxter State Parka is
pretty horrible, and I prefer the windstopper). Spend the money,
seriously.

Also, a jacket like this will not be your only layer.

If you’re willing to spend the extra money, [Canada
Goose](http://www.canadagoose.com/us/en/home-page) jackets are also
supposed to be excellent, but their prices tend to climb up to the
\$1000 range. There are essentially no deals on Canada Goose; if you see
some random website claiming to be an outlet and offering Canada Goose
at like half price, it’s almost certainly counterfeit.

Also, Canada Goose is famously overpriced and fashionable these days.  Last winter, I decided to upgrade to an even-warmer jacket with real fur and such, so I went to the Canada Goose store in Boston.  They had---I kid you not---a *velvet rope* outside the door and forced people to wait in line to go inside (the store wasn't at capacity, and this was pre-COVID; they were just being pretentious).  Needless to say, I said "hell no" and went to Woolrich instead.  It turns out that was actually a really good idea, and I ended up snagging a just-as-good-as-Canada-Goose jacket for a little bit cheaper---basically [this jacket](https://www.woolrich.com/arctic-parka-with-detachable-fur-wo0103/) but in Gore-Tex.

I’m not terribly convinced by companies like North Face, Patagonia,
etc., but your mileage may vary. For light second layers/outer layers
when it’s only moderately cold (high 20’s, low 30’s), the very
thin/light down jackets (sometimes called “down sweaters”) from these
companies are expensive but nice. I have and quite like a Mountain
Hardwear “[ghost
whisperer](https://www.mountainhardwear.com/mens-ghost-whisperer-down-jacket-1560901.html)”
jacket along those lines. (Don't get the hooded version, though.  I have one of those too, which seems like a good idea, except there's no drawstring to keep the hood tight. So a slight breeze will just blow it down.)

A wise geology friend and walking commuter adds that if you get a
"technical" coat ("Technical" is, as far as I can tell, Expensive Jacket
Company-ese for "plastic." Think, the kinds of things hikers wear to
keep off the rain.), and you walk a lot, get one with "pit zips" (little
zippers under the armpits to let air out). You can wear one of those as
your outer layer for snow/wind/rain and such, with one of those down
sweater things on the inside for heat retention, and the pit zip will
allow you to regulate the heat and minimize sweatyness.

Shearling is also a good material for jacket linings. That’s what
they’ve used in places like Russia for a long time.

I’ve heard good things about another Canadian company called [Moose
Knuckles.](http://www.mooseknucklescanada.com/us/) It’s also just an
amazing name.

### Sweaters

Here is where the wool and fleece come in (not in your jacket please, it
won’t be nearly warm enough). Personally, I love alpaca.
[Novica](https://www.novica.com/) (a fair trade wing of National
Geographic) sells a ton of alpaca products from some lovely Peruvian
folks. I own [this
sweater](https://www.novica.com/itemdetail/?pid=160867) and it gets
near-daily use during the winter. Watch out for the alpaca “blends” on
Novica, which tend to be blended with the horror that is acrylic.

I mostly only use polyester fleece for going to the gym, because it’s a
bit more durable and much cheaper than the good stuff.

### Scarves

These are also \[sheep\] wool or alpaca. Novica has lots of scarves too,
but so do many other places that are probably cheaper. There’s also
something called a “neck warmer” (a.k.a. “neck gaiter”) which allegedly
is warmer and cheaper than a scarf and can be pulled over mouth and
nose. I’ve never used one, but this comes from Canadian Friend, who
understands such things, and provides [this
example](https://www.amazon.com/Original-Turtle-Fur-Fleece-Heavyweight/dp/B0041VWW4G).
(Although maybe not quite that one, because, acrylic. You know how Your
Advisor feels about acrylic.)

### Long Underwear

A.K.A. undershirts, leggings, “longjohns.” You should get some. They’re
very cheap on the internet and at places like Target. They’re also
outrageously expensive at Active Endeavors on the ped mall. (Everything
is outrageously expensive at Active Endeavors: don’t go there unless
you’re rich.) You should also invest in some thick wool socks.

However, watch out for the cheap stuff here because it might be “thermal
cotton.” See above for why cotton is a terrible idea. Look for polyester
or silk.

A Canadian friend adds: “Women: opaque tights are warmer than trousers
or jeans. Nylon stockings are useless.”

I buy most of my winter supplies online, but Fin and Feather, an outdoor
store down on Highway 6, also seems to have a lot of stuff.

### Gloves

Here is a big utility/warmth tradeoff. Mittens (gloves with one big
compartment for all your fingers, as opposed to individual fingers) tend
to be much warmer, basically because the heat your fingers emit goes to
one another rather than nowhere (also surface area is lower). However,
it’s nearly impossible to actually use your hands in mittens.

In particular, *do not try to use your phone with gloves, even if you
have alleged “touchscreen gloves.”* First, touchscreen gloves don’t
work. Worse, gloves compromise your grip a lot more than you’ll think.
I’ve personally had two iPhones slip out of my hands onto concrete that
way. The closest Apple Store is in Des Moines, a two-hour drive away. I
speak from experience here: you do not want to drive two hours in winter
to get a several-hundred-dollar screen replacement because you tried to
look at your texts with gloves on.

Typically I carry both medium-weight leather gloves lined with cashmere
for ordinary days, and shearling-lined mittens for really cold days. A
company called [Overland](http://www.overland.com/) has a great supply
of both gloves and mittens, and I tend to order everything from there.
It’s a little expensive, but they have lots of sales. [These are my
usual
mittens.](http://www.overland.com/products/b-3-sheepskin-mittens-72001.aspx)
And
[these](http://www.overland.com/products/mens-dents-dunmore-cashmere-lined-deerskin-leather-and-twee-74512.aspx)
are my usual (light) gloves (not appropriate for spending more than a
couple minutes outside in winter temperatures, mostly used to get from
the parking lot to a building/while driving).  (Overland is one of my favorite winter stuff companies. They have a retail store in Chicago.)

I also typically keep some cheap-o fabric gloves in every jacket pocket,
the car, my bag, etc., because it can be really unpleasant to be caught
without a spare pair. Also, the cheap-o gloves can be worn under mittens
so that you can very quickly take a mitten off, do something with the
hand, and then quickly get the mitten back on without losing any
fingers.

North Face also has some good ski gloves made of some kind of space
polyester, which are a bit warmer than day-to-day gloves, but slightly
more compatible with actually using your hands than mittens.

### Hats

Your basic options here are polyester fleece, wool, and fur. I have all
three, but strongly prefer fur: it’s the warmest and most comfortable.
Overland has lots of them. I have [this
hat](http://www.overland.com/products/down-filled-trapper-hat-with-rabbit-fur-trim-73250.aspx)
and a hat similar to [this
one](http://www.overland.com/products/vintage-leather-aviator-hat-with-rabbit-fur-trim-73227.aspx).
Earflaps are a must. I typically wear these hats under the hood of my
Windstopper jacket.

### Boots

Here, I don’t have great advice: I’ve never found a pair of winter boots
I’ve been happy with. Right now I wear [these
boots](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00Q7JETIC/), and they’re OK.
Not amazing (the laces get stiff and salty and annoying), but I can
stomp through a snow drift in them and not get my feet soaked so there’s
that.

Generally, wool-lined is good. Wear them with thick wool socks and your
feet will be toasty as all get out. For women, the [Joan of Arctic
Boot](http://www.sorel.com/womens-joan-of-arctic-boot-1708791.html)
comes recommended, with some caveats about possible durability issues.

A number of people have also recommended L.L. Bean boots. A member of
the Cold-Weather People Editorial Board which I have decreed to exist
and which is comprised of the various friends cited in here also
suggests Keen Targhee II Mid boots, at least for snow under 6 inches
(more comes over the top)

### Ski Masks and Ski Goggles

People make fun of me for wearing these, but I like to keep my lips, my
nose and my eyeballs. Do what you want. For the purpose of internet
searches, a ski mask is also called a “balaclava.” I also have a weird
combination ski mask/hat thing that I found in a random store in Chicago
but is magical, and if I knew what it was called I would totally tell
you to buy one, but I don’t, so you’ll just have to ask me to show you
on a cold day.

### Ski Pants, Snow Pants, etc.

Basically anything with “ski” in the name or “snow” in the name is nice.
I have [a gigantic pair of snow overall
pants](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004C6QT1M/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
that I wear on the worst days. They’re ugly as hell, but they’re also
super warm and super waterproof (and super cheap). With those and good
solid boots, I can literally walk straight through a snowbank and not
notice. And have actually done so.

### Some More Brand Names from a Friend

I’ve had some other people look at this guide, and they have offered
suggestions. Here’s one set of clothing recommendations:

> Frankly, L.L. Bean all the things (lifetime guarantee)!! Spanx makes
> really great tights that are much warmer than pants. Columbia (they
> have great outlet stores, too) has coats, tech shirts, gloves,
> headbands (girls, protect your ears!!!) with this special lining that
> is silver and retains heat - I call it my microwave gear because it’s
> that good. Barbour coats and vests are fabulous - I have a warmer coat
> that is water resistant (not water proof but I don’t live in Portland
> anymore!), quilted cavalry coat, and quilted cavalry vest. North Face
> mid-weight ski pants save my life because they’re form fitting and
> very flattering. Arcteryx and Fjallraven make awesome and reliable
> gear, too. Dale of Norway sweaters are a good investment. Prana makes
> reliable, warm, comfy yoga-inspired stuff and is flattering. I’m
> vegan, also allergic to wool (pre-vegan), and have struggled at times
> to stay perfectly true when buying winter gear. Admittedly, I have a
> down parka that I’ll keep for all of time and a few items with
> leather. Wool substitutes are fairly easy to find, thankfully.

(Editorial note/dissent: I’m pretty skeptical of Barbour, which seem to
be mostly made for yuppies to wear on the decks of their yachts and are
crazy expensive. Also, I think Dale of Norway is a bit overrated and
also you’re really buying the brand name there.)

> In summation: investing a little more money up front for long-lasting
> gear is totally worth it. Good deals can be found online: 6pm, Sierra
> Trading Post, Backcountry, REI Outlet, eBay, LLBean - get coupon codes
> and promos. Add the Honey extension to your Chrome browser, as a total
> aside!

## Driving

Driving is extremely dangerous in winter. (But god help you if you try
and walk long distances. And if you bicycle, can I please have your MP3
collection when you’re gone?) If you’ve never driven on snow or ice
before, think about the maximum terrified-driver level of care you can
imagine, and then double it.

Let’s put it this way: the first time I drove in snow, I hit a tree
within five minutes.

You can very easily skid and lose control when you brake, accelerate, or turn. Do all of those things very, very, very gradually. Leave tons of extra
stopping distance.

You should *definitely* not change speeds and turn at the same time.
Slow down, THEN turn, THEN speed up again. Or else you’ll instantly fly
out of control.

Winter tires may be useful, if you can find a storage solution. (The law where you are might not allow them, or might only allow them in specific months of the year, so you should look into that.)

There’s a thing called “black ice.” That’s cold-place-ese for “ice you
can’t see.” It’s real. So when driving, even if a patch of road looks
clear of ice, you could suddenly lose traction. Be aware.

If you do skid, there is a lot of contradictory advice floating around
out there, so I’m not going to try to give recommendations.

Please don’t try to use a rear wheel drive car.

People drive like idiots in parts of the Midwest, especially, for some reason, Iowa. When it’s dry and sunny, they
drive about 20 mph slower than they ought; when it’s raining or snowing
they drive about 20mph faster than they ought. That’s why you’ll see
countless cars in the ditch on every freeway in Iowa in the
winter. Don’t let that be you. Just let the testosterone-mad pickup
truck morons pass.

### Don’t Get Stranded and Freeze to Death in Your Car

If you can, get roadside assistance through your insurance company (or
AAA if you must, but AAA contractors tend to be incredibly unreliable).
Car breakdowns are more frequent in the winter, you can slide off into
the ditch, etc. Also, extreme cold can kill your car batteries
overnight, and definitely if you leave town for a while.

You might do well to talk to a mechanic about special oil, wiper fluid,
etc. for the winter.

Also, keep a kit in your car that consists, at a minimum, of:

-   a shovel to dig out of the snow

-   a brush + ice scraper to get snow and ice off your windshield

Those are sold at truck stops and the like.

If you go out of town, you should also keep emergency survival supplies
in your car to survive long enough for rescue to arrive. These include blankets, chemical hand warmers, food, water, and maybe flares, etc.

Fuel lines can freeze; keep the tank about half full at all times in the
winter.

Tire pressure goes down in the winter. Check it when it gets cold, and
add more air.

From a Canadian friend:

> Keep a blanket or sleeping bag in your car at all times. If you skid
> off the road in a snowstorm, you can be waiting for hours for a tow.
> Cars get freezing cold in about half an hour. You can literally freeze
> to death in your car. So always dress for the weather (hat, gloves,
> winter coat) even if you don’t intend to spend time outside.

Engine block heaters will help with the cold killing your car battery.

Canadian friend again:

> if you have trouble getting rolling on an icy surface, start your car
> in third gear (if standard) or using the special traction gear (if
> automatic–it might be called D1 or B or something). Don’t spin your
> wheels. It won’t help.

(Editorial note: personally, I’ve never seen the special traction gear,
but maybe it’s only in Jeeps and such?)

From an Iowan friend:

> If it’s forecast to sleet overnight or while you’re parked outside
> during the day, lift up your windshield wipers. Makes it much easier
> to chip off the sleet later.

(Editorial note: “sleet” is similar to “freezing rain” in that both are
kinds of rain that are liquid-ish in the sky but freeze on surfaces they
come into contact with. So the issue here is that you might well get a
windshield encrusted with ice, and that’s bad.)

> Remove as much accumulated snow as possible before driving the car,
> not just the areas of highest importance. Blowing snow off your moving
> vehicle is a driving hazard for others.

(Editorial note: there’s also a realism constraint here. It takes
FOREVER to get snow off a car. The housing at the Institute for Advanced
Study in Princeton has wonderful central vacuum cleaners with big long
hoses, and there’s a longstanding rumor that one day a physicist broke
the whole system by getting impatient with the tortuous snow removal
process and trying to vacuum it off.)

> A big piece of cardboard can provide traction if your wheels are stuck
> and spinning in the snow.

> Iowa City likes to plow big snow berms into the middle of the street.
> Use extreme caution when trying to cross them on either foot or in
> vehicle. They are treacherous.

(Editorial note: also, if you park a bike outside, bring it inside at
the first sight of snow, especially if it’s in a city bike rack. Once, my wife had her bike stuck
in a gigantic block of ice/snow all winter, thanks to Iowa City's malicious municipal
government deciding to plow a pile of snow *directly on top of it*. That, needless to say, was not a cheap repair when it
melted.)

## Money Matters

You’ll notice that many of the suggestions in here are fairly expensive.
Some of this is the nature of the beast: people who blither on about the
“low cost of living” around here conveniently forget about weather when
they calculate all that stuff. At some point in around month 3 of living
in Iowa I just threw up my hands and said “I’ll spend what I need to not
freeze to death.”

That being said, I’m told there are more affordable options. I shared
this guide with a dear friend who did her Ph.D. at Iowa, and she had
some grad student budget suggestions, which I reproduce here:

> A lot of stuff you mentioned is pretty expensive. For example
> Yaktrax–if you can swing it, sure, but you’re wearing boots without
> traction (which is a rookie move), I’d take a knife or scissors to the
> sole and scuff them up.

> I’ve found that the most valuable resource of clothing fit for Iowa is
> people who are moving–they usually have good stuff that they think
> they won’t need again. Also, the thrift and consignment stores locally
> aren’t exactly fashion-forward, but they are filled with wools and
> good base fabric material. The consignment stores in Chicago (there’s
> a Crossroads and Buffalo Exchange across from each other in Wicker
> Park) are better.

> Regarding O’Hare in the winter: the hostels are expensive
> (\$20/night), but you’re closest bet to the airport is IHSP in Wicker
> Park.



My Canadian friend adds, regarding the cost of winter coats:

> Also, don’t buy your winter coat in California. Wait until you get to
> Iowa, then have a local friend help you shop. The things that get
> passed off as winter coats in California or NYC really aren’t.

> I have never paid more than \$500 for a winter coat. Fortunately, the
> \$500 ones last forever. Have your local friend take you to
> Marshall’s.

# Surviving Spring

Fluctuating wildly between freezing and storming. If you hear a really loud “boom” it’s a thunderstorm, not a terrorist attack (probably). It can go from dry and sunny to 5 inches of water  on the ground in about 10 minutes; in that same period it can also start dropping golfball style hail. I once got caught out in the middle of nowhere on the freeway in one of those, and am alive today mainly because my windshield held. People tend to hide under freeway underpasses in this kind of situation, even though there are
persistent rumors that tornadoes will suck you out from under them
and slaughter you.
